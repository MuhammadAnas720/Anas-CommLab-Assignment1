Project Name: Communications Lab - Assignment 1 - 30 Minute Film Festival.

Project Description:
I tried to make a project on a Film Festival that is online, and features the movies we made in class. Since, it is a film festival, I have made the effort to market it like one. 

This includes promotion of films (Now Featuring section), a rating guideline, cast list. I also made trailers for each of the four films, to both market and engage the audience, so they can choose to see the film of their liking. 
To add to the overall experience, I tried to keep a Hollywood theme through the website - through use of Red, Black, and White color tones, camera, reel icons, backgrounds, etc. I have tried to make the experience as immerseive, engaging, and interactive for the user - as one would like. 

Process: 

The process started by making a wireframe for the web page on Adobe XD - to provide me a general idea on theme and design of my website. I then worked on implementing the project - from design and ideas to a ready web page. The first part for setting up an outline and content structure using HTML. This provide a good base for the website to then go in the "beautiful website" category. 

I looked up different color pallete themes online, to find the color tones that would work best. By combining a couple of them together, I was able to come up with a color theme of the website. I also looked into and used high-res stock photos that would complement and add to the theme / design. It then was time to implement structure, alignment, sizing, coloring, and other design details through CSS. 
I also tried to make two webpages, one links to the other to ply the video. For this, I used two CSS files, to help me better organize my work, by page specific content.

I made the experience interactive / immersive by having consistent color themes, buttons, display of trailers when you hover over films, and a very functional navigation bar. 

I used javascript for one interactivity element. When you hover over the film in "NOW FEATURING", the specific trailer for the movie starts playing. I think this really helps user to see the offerings in a more meaningful way, by looking at the trailer, before deciding if they want to watch it. So when user hovers over the movie thumbnail, it hovers and pops open, and when they remove mouse over it, it reduces back in size.

I also tried to welcome user feedback for the movie and the film festival. So they can click on message me, and their email box will open, allowing them to email me directly. 

Reflection/Evaluation: 

I was able to accomplish pretty much everything I planned in the intial stage. In fact, I realized that more I delved in and got hands-on in it, I had a better idea of how to proceed forward. This meant realizing that this particular feature or element would look even better.

One reflection is that making an interactive and engaiging website like this took much longer than I had anticipated. A large part of that is because many interactive elements, specially CSS takes a lot of trial and error. You never know how a particular color, font, or width size would appeal, unless you actually code and try it. if you don't like it, you have to consistently try other options that would work best.

As a self-evaluation, i tried my best to think in terms of a user browsing my webpage. I put my primary focus on User Experience. I hope it worked.
